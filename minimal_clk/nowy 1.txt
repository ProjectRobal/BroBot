If it snows today , I will put on a coat.

If the bees all died , We would die of starvation.

If you go to the Grand Canyon , You will see something beautifull.

If your new phone breaks, you will buy a new one.

If I hadn't gone on that holiday, I would not have visited some extraordinary places.

If I hadn't asked for help , I wouldn't have soleved that problem.

If I'd had different friends, I would have been probably different person now.

If I'd gone to a different school , I would probably have different expiriences.
